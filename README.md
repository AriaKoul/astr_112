# astr_112

This repository contains all the code for the assignments I did for ASTR 112, Physics of Stars, which is an upper division class at UC Santa Cruz.

Most of the work in this repository is analyzing the Gaia Catalog, which is a catalog that contains characteristics, such as distance, luminosities, and location, of more than a billion stars in the night sky.
