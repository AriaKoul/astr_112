# ASTR 112 - Physics of Stars 

This repository contains all the code for the assignments I did for ASTR 112, Physics of Stars, which is an upper division class at UCSC.

The work in this repository includes analyzing the Gaia Catalog, which is a catalog that contains characteristics, such as distance, luminosities, and location, of more than a billion stars in the night sky. I downloaded star data from the [Gaia Esa Archive](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/) and converted it into csv files, which I then filtered based on given baselines. The data is in the "Data Files" folder. Using the filtered data, I developed python programs to create color magnitude diagrams that represent various stars' properties.
